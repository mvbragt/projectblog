    <h3>About</h3>
    <p> Hi welcome to Life's Ascent: Marloes - Solving problems and Nuturing Hearts, the personal corner of a woman's life journey.
      Meet Marloes, a loving wife and a doting mother to three adventurous children who are the heart and soul of her world.
      <br>
      <br>
      This blog is an open window into the wonderful blend of her roles as a devoted family woman and a trailblazing software engineer.
      My story begins with a deep-seated passion for technology and problem-solving.
      <br>
      Her career as a software engineer is a testament to her tenacity and the love she has for crafting innovative solutions.
      She has shattered glass ceilings and shown that the world of coding knows no gender boundaries.
      But her life extends far beyond the confines of her career.
      <br>
      <br>
      When the workday ends, Marloes, her loving husband, and their three lively kids embark on exciting outdoor adventures. Hiking, climbing, and exploring the beauty of nature have become integral to their family's identity.
      The mountains and trails serve as both their playground and their sanctuary, forging unforgettable bonds and timeless memories.
      <br>
      <br>
      This blog is a tapestry of my life, woven with the threads of family love, technical prowess, and a deep connection to the natural world. Join us on this journey as we explore the challenges and triumphs of a woman who has found her balance in a world of adventure and algorithms.
      <br>
      <br>
      Get ready to be inspired by my tales of motherhood, marriage, and mastering the code. Whether you're a fellow outdoor enthusiast, a working parent, or a tech aficionado, there's something here for everyone. Together, let's celebrate the beauty of a life lived to the fullest, where family, nature, and software engineering all coexist in perfect harmony.
