          <h3>A Family Adventure: Hiking in La Hoegne with Marloes and Crew</h3>
          <p>Nestled in the breathtaking Belgian Ardennes, La Hoegne is a place where nature's serenity meets the thrill of adventure.
            Me and my family, recently embarked on a memorable hiking adventure in this picturesque region.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a passionate climber, I know that the great outdoors is where my heart finds its rhythm. With Wesley (my husband) by my side and our three adventurous boys in tow,
            La Hoegne offered the perfect backdrop for our family escapade of about 8km in total <em>(according to the preparation)</em>.
            <br>
            <br>
            The lush forests, meandering streams, and the symphony of birdsong were a welcomed departure from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
            As we trekked through the enchanting trails, we found it was a challenge for our youngest son of six years, who is quite short.
            But With every step, we discovered the joy of conquering new heights.

            After 6,5 to 7km we found ourselves halfway through the hike.
            So the length of the trail we found in the preparation wasn't a good estimate. So now we had to hike almost the double.
            But La Hoegne is such a beautiful forrest with her streams and height difference and all the things to spot that it didn't feel like double.
            We did decide to take the easy route back as the youngest was really tired of the steep climbing for him.

            At the end of the trail where you also start, there is a nice stream where the kids can play.
            The kids really enjoyed playing in the stream and the hiking in this lushes forrest and all her treasures.
            <br>

            <b><em>La Hoegne you were great and beautiful!</em></b>
